# janyksteenbeek.nl

This is the repository for version 2024 of my personal website, [janyksteenbeek.nl](https://janyksteenbeek.nl). It is
using Preact, even though it's a bit overkill for a personal website. I just wanted to try it out.

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start a development server on http://localhost:5173/. Not sure why you would want to run this locally, but you
can.
